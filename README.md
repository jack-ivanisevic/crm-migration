# CRM Migration Case Study: Mailchimp → Klaviyo

## Overview

This case study outlines a full-scale CRM platform migration I completed for a client, transitioning their email and lifecycle marketing workflows from Mailchimp to Klaviyo. The project included data preparation, subscriber property mapping, automation rebuilding, deliverability configuration, and establishing a more scalable segmentation and reporting structure.

The objective was to create a cleaner, more automated, and more intelligent CRM ecosystem capable of supporting long-term growth and improved personalization.
